1. tools used: COVERT tool, beautiful soup & D3 analysis tool

2.steps for getting visualization:
a. Run the COVERT tool on the 20 apk files. This will give you the corresponding xml files for each application & the other analysis results.
b. Run the testparser.py on these 20 xml files one at a time. It will extract the components,permissions,intents and other resources for each app and store it in a json format. Thus you will have corresponding 20 json files.
c. Run the compare.py file on these 20 json files. It will give you the interacting components and store them in another json file(compared.json)
d. Create a folder and store inside it the index.html file(visualization file) and the D3 folder(containing D3 library).
The visualization shows the interactions between the different components, the various permissions and the intents that each app sends. 
The results are shown in the image files (.png) attached.

Note: use chrome browser to view the visualizations
